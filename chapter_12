** Why Write Comments? The Four Excuses **
~~ Section 12.1 ~~

Comments on the code is a must have. It hides the complexity, conveys informal nuances, and improve overall design.

Huge number of people either don't believe in writing comments, some don't know how to write good comments. 

Some common reasons:
1. Good code is self documenting: 
No. You can only have a function signature - parameters and returns.
What about the design decisions, assumptions of a state? 
If #developers will have to read implementation to understand what is going on then there is no abstraction.
We don't have time for this.

2. Same group goes to other extreme and says, 'I don't have time to write comments':
In the first few posts, we covered that good design is some time investment, and returns are rather early than you anticipate.

3. Comments become outdated quickly, and can rather be misleading:
Well, don't you think updating the comments should rather be a solution? Some techniques are there on Day 16.

4. All comments I have seen are worthless:
This sounds legit. But the reason is - it is not taught in the schools how to write good comments.
Next few days of posts are going to be focused on how to write good comments.
