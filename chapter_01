As any program or system evolves and more features are added, its complexity inevitably increases.
Simpler design allows us to build larger, more powerful systems before complexity becomes overwhelming.

Modular design helps fight the complexity.
It means encapsulating the complexity, so that programmers can work on relatively independent components without being exposed to all of the complexity at once.

People tried waterfall model strategy - it demands considerable sized components be designed first, then developed.
Its hard to understand all the implications beforehand, causing initial design to be full of problems.
Many of these problems are not apparent until significant implementation is done.
Racing against time, this results in patchy solutions and reduces scope for adding features seamlessly in the future.

So, waterfall does not work. What should we do? Read the next post..
